# Project 1A - COMP3330 Machine Intelligence

Name: Cam Le Messurier
St No: 3301398

This project was completed by myself only, as I was never assigned a group or realised we needed one.

Each assignment question is addressed in each respective notebook; Q1, Q2 and Q3. The data for each question can be found in `/data`.

You will need to install the appropriate python libraries for the notebooks to work, however most are common and you probably already have them installed.

Thanks, Cam.
